### Hello!

I've been building web pages since the early 90's and people have been paying me for it for almost as long. From the typical origins as an enthusiastic but naive junior developer, through senior developer roles and now onto a mix of staff IC and manager positions, I continue to have the same passion for JavaScript and coding that I found thirty years ago. I hope you'll find something of interest to you here!

Please check out my CLI card using `npx -y martindoyle@latest`.
